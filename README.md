# Weather App

The assignment was to create a weather app where we fetch() the weather from an API. 

Our weather app uses API, DOM manipulation and functions in Javascript to show the weather for a specific city. From the API we have fetched information for todays weahter and a forecast for the weather following four days. That way our app shows the wether for five days at a time. 


## The problem

During the week we had more than one problem to solve but figured it out by using chatGPT, google and our team. We also found a lot of useful information on the APIs website which helped us figure out how to fetch the different types of data. 

As we submit our project there are still a few bugs that we would've fixed if we had more time. One bug that we noticed at the end was that when the app decides which background to show (dark if it's night and light if it's day) the function uses the time of users computer, and not the real time of the city it's showing, meaning it can show the day-background even if it's night time in the city it's showing.
